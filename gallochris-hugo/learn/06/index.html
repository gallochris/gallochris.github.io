				<h1 id="06-move-on">06: Move on</h1>
<p>Biggest takeaway this week was remember to move on. Don&rsquo;t stay mad. Drive forward. Shit happens. Keep on keeping on.</p>
<h2 id="consuming">Consuming</h2>
<p><em>More Scorecast</em></p>
<p>Finished reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scorecasting-Hidden-Influences-Behind-Sports/dp/0307591808">Scorecasting</a> by Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim this week.</p>
<p>Continuation of notes below:</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7: Rounding first</strong>: people have a bias to round numbers. It&rsquo;s why more batters hit .300 than .299.</p>
<p>A batter is close to .300 at end of season? He won&rsquo;t play.</p>
<p>This is incentive bias. A rounder number (100 RBI, .300) usually leads to better salary.</p>
<p>Bobby Abreu finished with exactly 20 or 30 home runs five times, seven times exactly 100 or 100 RBI, and no seasons with 95 to 99 RBI.</p>
<p>Same true in NFL with 1,000 rushers.</p>
<p>You can find value in looking at players just below these benchmarks.</p>
<p>People view acts of <em>omission</em> - the absence of an act - as far less harmful than acts of <em>commission</em> - actually committing the act, even if the outcomes are the same or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8: Thanks, Mr. Rooney:</strong> the drop-off of black coaches winning is actually a good thing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It validates the Rooney rule. Black coaches are held to same standard as white counterparts. They&rsquo;re equal.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 9: Comforts of Home:</strong> there is a home-field advantage in all sports. It&rsquo;s a bit more strong in some sports, but it&rsquo;s the same regardless of where sport is played.</p>
<p>There is significant incentive to win at home - concessions, people leave happy, spend more money.</p>
<p>But why does home field advantage exist?</p>
<p>Because of crowd support? No. Look at kicks in football, free throws, shootouts - when you control for a situation where crowd could impact game, it really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Because of travel? No, evidence isn&rsquo;t strong that travel plays a major role.</p>
<p>Because of scheduling? Yes.</p>
<p>NBA teams play lots of back-to-back games, and this does favor the home team. It&rsquo;s less of an issue in certain sports like MLB.</p>
<p>More extreme in college football. Teams pad schedule with hosting weak opponents.</p>
<p>Scheduling bias explains some of home field advantage, but not in baseball or NFL or soccer at all.</p>
<p>Because of unique home characteristics? Not really, some impact, but not huge difference. Hard to really have an edge with unique home fields today.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 10: What is driving home field advantage</strong> officials or referee bias is most significant factor.</p>
<p>Study used QuesTec data to determine officials or umpires side with the home team in pressure situations on borderline calls.</p>
<p>More ambiguous the call? More likely to go in home team&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>Why? Confirmation bias.</p>
<p>Humans conform because they want to fit in and because they believe the group is better informed than they are.</p>
<p>Officials aren&rsquo;t really aware of the bias, it&rsquo;s just a natural human response.</p>
<p>Answered three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does home field advantage differ across sports?</li>
</ol>
<p>Because refs or officials are more important or have more influence on the game. Soccer more than baseball. A penalty kick is huge, where umpire calls are fairly black and white.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why is it the same for a sport no matter where its played?</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the role of the referee is the same no matter if soccer is played in America or Europe or Spain.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Why hasn&rsquo;t it changed much over time?</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the officials role hasn&rsquo;t changed with the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 11: No I in Team</strong>: But there is an m and an e.</p>
<p>There is a bigger influence of superstars in certain sports like basketball.</p>
<p>Disagree with soccer, think it&rsquo;s much less.</p>
<p>Makes sense in basketball. Only 5 players play at a time.</p>
<p>Where in baseball, a player might only get 3 at-bats a game. In soccer, only a few touches by your best attacker.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan - There is an I in win. So which way do you want it?</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 12: Off the chart</strong> Mike McCoy came to own the NFL draft using a value chart that was largely designed off assumptions.</p>
<p>Tried to answer - what is the value of a draft pick in a certain round?</p>
<p>Value of the first pick in draft was 3000, and first pick in second round 580, and final pick was 0.4.</p>
<p>The chart just gave the Cowboys a framework.</p>
<p>It more or less stated value in multiple picks versus one high pick.</p>
<p>Opposite is when the Saints traded eight draft picks for Ricky Williams. Overpaid by a ton.</p>
<p>Eventually when all teams started using the chart, it became obsolete. Thaler and Massey found inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Teams would overpay to pick today versus playing the long game. Not comfortable with uncertainty.</p>
<p>It takes talent to evaluate talent.</p>
<p>Draft pick value is different for different sports. Seven rounds in NFL, just two in NBA, and 50 in MLB.</p>
<p>Find value by looking at the details. Ask why.</p>
<p>Brady didn&rsquo;t play at Michigan more because of political reasons than his ability.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 13: Coin toss trumps all:</strong> If you won the coin toss in overtime for NFL, you win 61 percent of time.</p>
<p>This prompted changes in the NFL overtime rule. It wasn&rsquo;t really fair.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 14: What isn&rsquo;t in the Mitchell Report</strong> Dominican players were more likely to take steroids because of cultural and situational needs. All incentive bias.</p>
<p>The upside was far greater for Dominican players than American players. A lot of Dominicans were much younger, where American players were older and trying to get one last big contract.</p>
<p>MLB gave players choice to act immorally and from an economic perspective, act irrationally.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 15: Does icing the kicker or shooter work?</strong> No. It&rsquo;s a lukewarm strategy.</p>
<p>Study looked at NFL kicks and NBA free throws. Found no difference in performance.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 16: Myth of the Hot Hand:</strong> Momentum in sports doesn&rsquo;t exist. We just believe it does because we like patterns. We don&rsquo;t like mystery.</p>
<p>Randomness and luck resist explanation.</p>
<p>Try flipping a coin 100 times. There will be streaks of heads or tails. Those streaks don&rsquo;t increase the odds the next flip will land on heads.</p>
<p>We do a really poor job at understanding randomness. You aren&rsquo;t due for anything. Your chances do not change because of a streak.</p>
<p>The true quality of teams can be measured in large sample sizes. Small samples are dominated by randomness.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 17: Damned statistics</strong> You can make numbers say whatever you want. It&rsquo;s selective. And more than one thing can be true.</p>
<p>Be objective. Neutral. Look at as much data as possible to get a more accurate picture.</p>
<p>Not just short-term numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 18: Are the Cubs cursed?</strong> No, they&rsquo;re not cursed or super unlucky.</p>
<p>It was deeply ingrained in the team that wins and losses didn&rsquo;t matter. Wrigley wanted fans to enjoy the ballgame, win or lose. Lovable losers.</p>
<p>Cubs could lose and attendance could go up. This wasn&rsquo;t the case for almost all other teams.</p>
<p>Beer prices remained flat. Cubs fans went to game for experience, not for wins.</p>
<p>Curses aren&rsquo;t to blame or Steve Bartman.</p>
<p>Interesting to see how Cubs expectations have now changed since winning a World Series.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue:</strong> it was really hard to name the book.</p>
<p>What does title mean?</p>
<p>Ignore data and diverse views as your own peril. Seek controversial or opposite opinions and challenge convention to improve your decision making.</p>
