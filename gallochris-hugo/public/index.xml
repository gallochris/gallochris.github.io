Consuming More Scorecast
Finished reading Scorecasting by Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim this week.
Continuation of notes below:
Chapter 7: Rounding first: people have a bias to round numbers. It&amp;rsquo;s why more batters hit .300 than .299.
A batter is close to .300 at end of season?</description>

      <description>05: Value of the Act Value was a theme this week in what I read or consumed. Not all stats are created equal. Value in the act, not the act itself. It was a challenge to deal with uncertainity this week too.
Consuming Scorecast
Checked out Scorecasting by Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim from the library.
Started reading this week, notes below:

Consuming Sivers book notes: Courage to be disliked
Ton of tidbits from Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga&amp;rsquo;s book, Sivers notes are great.
Notes that stood out with my own perspective:
Meaning to experiences: we are not determined by our experiences, but by the meaning we give them.</description>

Consuming Comment from reddit
This is maybe best reddit comment I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. It comes from ryans01.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the 4 rules in my own words:

      <description>01: Fast and Curious Fast and curious. I thought this would be a fun name for a blog or newsletter for some reason. It&amp;rsquo;s silly.
But also a good a way to try to explain what I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to accomplish with this exercise. The goal is to write down or publish what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to help me retain it and motivate me to keep learning new things.
It&amp;rsquo;s total stream of consciousness based off what I consumed and created during the past week or so.</description>

      <description>HOW MY BOSS DESCRIBES ME  I hired Chris because he was already doing support for me at Draft for free and I hadn’t even asked him to :) He’s incredibly ambitious and helpful in every aspect of your business, way beyond typical support. He’ll run your business if you want him to. I promise you, customers will write in to you about how much they love Chris.

      <description>Don&#39;t criticize, condemn or complain.  Give honest, sincere appreciation.  Arouse in the other person an eager want.  Become genuinely interested in other people.  Smile.  Remember that a person&#39;s name is to that person, the most important sound in any language.  Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.  Talk in terms of the other person&#39;s interest.  Make the other person feel important - and do so sincerely.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s up with hot dogs and eggs? Most people claim their own name as a domain (chrisgallo.com). But my namesakes at Ernest and Julio Gallo Winery have commandeered domains that include the word &amp;ldquo;gallo&amp;rdquo; in them.
So when I started this site in 2014, I was stumped on a domain name. And then I heard my grandma talking about making hot dogs and eggs for me as a kid. I kept saying it all day.</description>
