				<h1 id="05-value-of-the-act">05: Value of the Act</h1>
<p>Value was a theme this week in what I read or consumed. Not all stats are created equal. Value in the act, not the act itself. It was a challenge to deal with uncertainity this week too.</p>
<h2 id="consuming">Consuming</h2>
<p><em>Scorecast</em></p>
<p>Checked out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scorecasting-Hidden-Influences-Behind-Sports/dp/0307591808">Scorecasting</a> by Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim from the library.</p>
<p>Started reading this week, notes below:</p>
<p>Notes or ideas/passages that stuck out to me:</p>
<p><strong>All about insights</strong>: the information is all over the place, almost too much data. The power isn&rsquo;t in the data, but the insights you pull out it. Much tougher than it seems.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: Whistle Swallowing</strong>: all about officials and omission bias with loss aversion. Uses Mike Carey and David Tyree catch as fundamental example.</p>
<p>People view acts of <em>omission</em> - the absence of an act - as far less harmful than acts of <em>commission</em> - actually committing the act, even if the outcomes are the same or worse.</p>
<p>Food example - declining healthy food is a poor choice (omission), but eating junk food is worse (commission).</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos quote - &ldquo;people overfocus on errors of commission, failure&rsquo;s not that expensive, the big cost you incur is harder to notice, errors of omission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officials or refs, when the game steps up, you step down.</p>
<p>Swallow the whistle with judgement calls versus subjective calls when the game is about to end.</p>
<p>Subjective in football - holding, illegal blocks, illegal contact, and unnecessary roughness don&rsquo;t happen as often when game is on the line or at its end.</p>
<p>Objective calls - delay of game, illegal formation, motion, or shift are called at the same rate.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Go for it:</strong> Kevin Kelley always going for it on 4th down and never punting, he plays the odds and he also has job security and freedom to do so.</p>
<p>All about risk aversion.</p>
<p>Sparky Anderson - losing hurts twice as bad as winning feels good.</p>
<p>Would you rather want a $5 discount or avoid a $5 surcharge?</p>
<p>In sports, it&rsquo;s about punting even though the odds say to go for it on 4th down. Potential loss of field position or failing unconventionally means we avoid losses.</p>
<p>But why do you make risks?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to risk something when you expect to lose.</p>
<p>Job security is huge. Are you allowed to fail or be unconventional?</p>
<p>Belichick was not as aggressive until he won a Super Bowl. It built equity for him to take risks, fail, and not lose his job.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not enough either. Players must buy in too.</p>
<p>Tony LaRussa tried using pitchers for 3 innings apiece, but players didn&rsquo;t like it. They wanted wins (throw for 5 innings), because it drives their contract.</p>
<p>Paul Westhead at Lakers, didn&rsquo;t work. It worked at Loyola Marymount, but failed spectacularly with Denver Nuggets. Players buy in matters.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Tiger Woods is Human:</strong> more about loss aversion, it&rsquo;s a principle we dislike losing a dollar more than we enjoy earning a dollar.</p>
<p>PGA tour, measured putts from identical distance for birdies and pars, putts for par were far more successful. Players were so concerned with a loss, you’re more aggressive in avoiding bogey than scoring birdie.</p>
<p>Tendency to leave putts short for birdie, being too conservative.</p>
<p>Woods even says the psychological difference between making a birdie and dropping a shot is huge, more important to make a par putt. He’s human.</p>
<p>In the face of gain, we’re conservative.</p>
<p>In the face of loss, we’re aggressive.</p>
<p>It’s hard to block out <em>how</em> you got in a predicament. Remain even keel.</p>
<p>Endowment effect: feel the loss of something you own much more deeply than the loss of something you don’t own.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Offense wins championships:</strong> Defense is no more important than offense, both are equally important.</p>
<p>Defense requires effort, it’s less glorified, harder to measure, and dark (hidden).</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6: The value of a blocked shot:</strong> Value of blocked shots is in the details.</p>
<p>A blocked shot on a layup and you get the ball is more important than a block off an awkward, off-balance leaner.</p>
<p>Blocked shot back to opponent was assigned a value. Blocked shot out of bounds was slightly more valuable. Blocked ball to a teammate was worth the most.</p>
<p>It’s the value of the act, not the act itself that matters.</p>
<p>Counting is easy, measuring value is hard.</p>
<p>Tim Duncan’s 149 blocks were more valuable than Dwight Howard’s 232 blocks.</p>
<p><em>Bet the process podcast</em></p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/bettheprocess">New episode</a> discusses value and defense.</p>
<p>Defense is less predictive than offense. Trust an outstanding offense and average defense more than an average offense and outstanding defense.</p>
<p>Value isn’t positive odds, value is getting better odds than what you predict the odds should be. For example, Floyd Mayweather is a value pick at -500 if you predict odds should be -1500.</p>
<p><em>Sam Hinkie</em></p>
<p>Lists <a href="https://www.samhinkie.com/">side project ideas here</a>. This was fascinating, and something I want to explore. Might send an email.</p>
<p>Particularly, the pagination idea. Reading in the browser via long scroll isn&rsquo;t fun, would rather have pagination to show progess.</p>
