				<h1 id="09-what-you-care-about">09: What You Care About</h1>
<p>Biggest takeaway this week was to practice the game of judgment. It helps you determine what you care about and what motivates you.</p>
<h2 id="consuming">Consuming</h2>
<p><em>Dark Horse</em></p>
<p>Finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Horse-Achieving-Success-Fulfillment/dp/0062683632">Dark Horse</a> by Todd Rose and Ogi Ogas.</p>
<p>An interesting book about there being a path to success for everyone. It&rsquo;s about getting better at what you care about most, and not trying to be the same as everyone else.</p>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<p><strong>Personalized success</strong>: living a life of fulfillment <em>and</em> excellence.</p>
<p>You achieve personalized success by harnessing your individuality in the pursuit of fulfillment to achieve excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Standardization covenant</strong></p>
<p><strong>Four elements of Dark Horse mindset</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Know your micro-motives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>our schools and jobs were never designed to help you figure out what whets your appetite</li>
<li>these institutions believe in universal motives, but one size doesn&rsquo;t fit all</li>
<li>use the <em>game of judgment to define your micro-motives</em></li>
</ul>
<p>3 steps to the <em>game of judgment</em></p>
<p>a) become aware <em>when</em> you&rsquo;re judging someone/something
b) identify feelings, vivid reactions, when you&rsquo;re judging someone/something
c) ask <em>why</em> you are experiencing those feelings</p>
<p>The <em>game of judgment</em> isn&rsquo;t about other people/things at all. It&rsquo;s about you. It&rsquo;s all about the details. The specifics.</p>
<ul>
<li>motives can be contradictory - want to be around around people and be alone</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t <em>follow your passion</em></li>
<li><strong>engineer your passion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Know your choices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>be the same as everyone else, only better - that&rsquo;s not choosing, it&rsquo;s picking</li>
<li>picking is like using a menu at a restaurant</li>
<li>choosing is going to the grocery market and cooking dinner</li>
<li>choosing is an <em>active process</em></li>
<li>picking is a <em>passive process</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is all about <em>fit</em> - the match between your individuality and your circumstances.</p>
<p>The true power of choice is to find and select opportunities that activate the greatest number of your own micro-motives.</p>
<ul>
<li>luck isn&rsquo;t a dark horse strategy</li>
<li>dark horses are ok with the worst-case scenario too</li>
<li>what separates dark horses is <em>how they evaluate risk</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Standardization mindset says risk is <em>determined by odds</em>.</p>
<p>Dark horse mindset says risk is <em>determined by fit</em>.</p>
<p>Because if something is a good fit, the opportunity is low risk. If a poor fit, the opportunity is a high risk.</p>
<p>Susan Rogers story - she took a job as a receptionist at a studio. The <em>odds</em> say an average person successfully going from receptionist at a studio to musical engineer are low. But Susan said there was a good fit between her motives, so it wasn&rsquo;t a high risk.</p>
<p>A small difference in fit can lead to a large difference in fulfillment and excellence.</p>
<p><strong>3. Know your strategies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>standardization says there is <em>one best way</em></li>
<li>the truth is there are alternatives</li>
<li>knowing your strategies is a new way of thinking about the nature of your strengths</li>
</ul>
<p>Your micro-motives are part of your core identity, these are resistant to change. When we want something, we <em>feel</em> it.</p>
<p>You know with confidence whether you want to go skydiving or eat a plate of eel sushi or watch the latest Marvel movie.</p>
<p>Strengths are the opposite - inaccessible, contextual, and dynamic. Fuzzy.</p>
<ul>
<li>everything you label as a strength is a artificial construct or ability</li>
<li>abilities like programming or performing ballet are done through effort, learning</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How naturally gifted are you at riding a hippopotamus?</em></p>
<p>The only way to know is to try. You discern your strengths through action, not introspection.</p>
<p>Contextual strengths: say you have trouble reading text</p>
<ul>
<li>that&rsquo;s a shortcoming if you want to be a literary critic</li>
<li>if you want to be an astronomer, it might be an unexpected strength</li>
<li>if you have trouble reading, your brain is better detecting images like black holes</li>
<li>empathy is an asset for a nurse, and a shortcoming for a drone pilot</li>
<li>being tall is good for an NBA player, and bad for a coal miner</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic strengths: improve with practice, deteriorate through neglect</p>
<p>Your approach should be different when choosing a strategy than when choosing an opportunity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about <em>trial and error</em> not staying the course or choosing the one best way.</p>
<ul>
<li>you should expect failure</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s necessary to develop excellence with strategies</li>
<li>it unearths your fuzzy strengths</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, when you learn to know your micro-motives:</p>
<ul>
<li>you engineer your own passion</li>
<li>which endows you with energy and authenticity</li>
</ul>
<p>When you learn to know your choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>you engineer your own purpose</li>
<li>which provides you with meaning and direction</li>
</ul>
<p>And when you know your strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>you engineer your own achievement</li>
<li>which gives you a deep sense of pride and self-worth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Ignore the destination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unlearn things</li>
<li>destinations are catastrophic for fulfillment</li>
</ul>
<p>Standardized mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>standardized time (120 credit hours, MBA, certain degree) is to benefit institutions, not you</li>
<li>fixed dates makes it easier to assess people</li>
<li>this makes you believe that getting better is simply a matter of time</li>
</ul>
<p>Dark horse mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>time doesn&rsquo;t matter</li>
<li>the correct answer is it depends because time is relative</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t ask how long it takes to master something?</li>
<li>instead ask if this the <em>right strategy</em> for me to master something?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ignoring a destination is not the same as ignoring goals. A goal emerges out of your individuality. An active choice you have made.</p>
<p>A destination is someone else&rsquo;s idea of an objective that you acceded to. It&rsquo;s always contingent. For example, getting into Harvard Law is a destination.</p>
<p>A goal is winning your next debate club match, reading more philosophy books, and trying to get an internship. It&rsquo;s possible you will end up at Harvard Law. The self-knowledge you gain from these goals will open up new opportunities for you.</p>
<p><strong>Gradient ascent</strong>: it&rsquo;s like climbing to the highest peak. First, you start climbing in the direction of the steepest slope. Next, you pause and look around to gain a new vantage point to see if that&rsquo;s the right path to the peak. It&rsquo;s not fast. You repeat this until you reach the peak.</p>
<p><strong>Get better at thing things you care about most.</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Second part of the book is all about how the world is tied to this standardization mindset.</p>
<ul>
<li>talent isn&rsquo;t rare, there is a talent quota</li>
<li>this makes us believe very few have the <em>potential</em> for excellence</li>
<li>standardization mindset selects talent</li>
<li>dark horse mindset is about developing talent</li>
<li>a lottery system would be the only way to meet a quota and objectively evaluate candidates</li>
<li>use a jagged profile to show that everyone has talent</li>
<li>quotas lead to a negative-sum game (you win, I lose, if I win, you lose)</li>
<li>all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others</li>
<li>standardization qutoacracy, you don&rsquo;t need talent or hard work to climb the ladder, you need the right family or a fat wallet</li>
<li>redefine equal opportunity as equal fit</li>
<li>dark horse mindset says your goal is not to become the best in the nation, but to become the best version of yourself</li>
<li>equal fit is about guaranteeing individual choice</li>
<li>ask if an institutions provides both personalization and individual choice?</li>
<li>choice without personalization is picking (food menu)</li>
<li>Summit Public Schools example</li>
<li>Summit students have a dedicated mentor who meets with them one-on-one every week</li>
<li>Summit uses a lottery system to accept students, everyone has an equal chance</li>
<li>Southern New Hampshire University started College for America, it eliminated grades and credit hours, replaced with competency-based evaluations</li>
<li>every student has a mentor helping them make the best educational choice</li>
<li>no formal instructors, only academic coaches and reviewers</li>
<li>greater freedom of choice comes greater personal accountability</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Quote I like this week</em></p>
<p>You must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.</p>
