				<h1 id="03-slow-down">03: Slow down</h1>
<p>Biggest learning this week was to remember to slow down. Time moves faster as you get older, just slow down.</p>
<h2 id="consuming">Consuming</h2>
<p><em>Sivers book notes: Courage to be disliked</em></p>
<p>Ton of tidbits from Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://sivers.org/book/Disliked">Sivers notes</a> are great.</p>
<p>Notes that stood out with my own perspective:</p>
<p><strong>Meaning to experiences</strong>: we are not determined by our experiences, but by the meaning we give them.</p>
<p>Something doesn&rsquo;t go your way, you label yourself a failure, not always true.</p>
<p><strong>Anger</strong>: personal anger is nothing but a tool for making others submit to you. Anger is a form of communication, and that communication is possible without using anger.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re angry, explain how you <em>feel</em> and <em>ask questions</em>, don&rsquo;t shout or scream. It&rsquo;s silly.</p>
<p><strong>The past</strong>: no matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it has no bearing at all on how you live from now on.</p>
<p>Emphasis on <em>how</em> you live from now on. You get to choose.</p>
<p><strong>Relationships</strong>: forming good interpersonal relationships requires a certain degree of distance. You can&rsquo;t read a book if you push it up against your face, nor hold it too far away.</p>
<p>Distance. Moderation. Balance. All of it&rsquo;s needed. Be grounded, be centered.</p>
<p><strong>Judgement</strong>: you see only a part of things but judge the whole.</p>
<p>You generalize. Got to hear both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness</strong>: Happiness is the feeling of contribution. If you really have a feeling of contribution, you will no longer have any need for recognition from others.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling down, try contributing in a positive way and you will feel better.</p>
<p><strong>Change</strong>: no matter what moments you are living, or if there are people who dislike you, as long as you do not lose sight of the guiding star of <em>I contribute to others,</em> you will not lose your way, and you can do whatever you like.</p>
<p><em>Stats by Lopez</em></p>
<p>Michael Lopez runs data and analytics for the NFL. This series of posts is <a href="http://statsbylopez.netlify.com/post/lessons-hidden-in-sports-betting-markets/">fascinating</a>, and almost feels like an epiphany reading it.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s no single piece of public information that is more accurate and informative with respect to a professional sports game than the closing odds</li>
<li>luck plays an enormous role in sports outcomes, randomness happens a lot, especially in NFL and MLB</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t just look at standings, betting markets tell more predictive story</li>
<li>in the playoffs, the best team doesn&rsquo;t always win, NBA is an exception</li>
<li>single elimination tournaments add noise</li>
</ul>
<p>Couple more posts are in the works for this series. Curious how this would expand to college markets, Michael <a href="https://twitter.com/StatsbyLopez/status/1035322286356811776">gave some insight</a> there.</p>
<p><em>Bill Connelly and Bill Walsh</em></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/8/29/17337240/2018-nfl-preview-advance-stats-data-offense-defense-football-by-the-numbers">football therapy</a> post is super interesting. It felt almost like reading Basketball on Paper. Didn&rsquo;t realize Walsh wrote ins and outs of football.</p>
<p>Most important factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal down and distance in the open field</li>
<li>Backed-up situations near the goal line</li>
<li>Third downs</li>
<li>Different levels of the red zone</li>
<li>Blitz situations</li>
</ul>
<p>Importance of success rate is huge. All about down and distance:</p>
<p>So, if you get 50 percent of necessary yardage on first down, 70 percent on second down, or 100 percent on third or fourth down, it’s a successful play — and accordingly, success rate becomes an <em>on-base percentage</em> type of measure for football.</p>
<p>Want to dig in more on this post, and it changes way I watch the game.</p>
<p><em>Upside podcast with Dean Oliver</em></p>
<p>Good <a href="https://www.yurview.com/upside-podcast/dean-oliver/?utm_campaign=Sports%20-%20July%202018&amp;utm_content=76519732&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">conversation</a> with Dean Oliver on state of basketball analytics, and he hints a new version of Basketball on Paper is coming soon.</p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<p>Four factors are still where it all starts. It gives the sport a framework on how to improve and what wins in the game.</p>
<p>There is danger in using plus/minus and lineup combinations because the amount of time players are on court together is usually not long enough. Sample size is too small. Competition plays a huge role here. You simply don&rsquo;t have much data, and it&rsquo;s tough to capture interactions.</p>
<p>If something jumps out as surprising, be careful because it could just be something random.</p>
<p>Models are always approximations of reality. Oliver references how he couldn&rsquo;t project Steve Nash right. When you tweak a model, you improve ones you got wrong, but lose the ones you got right. A lot of intangibles are involved, qualitative data.</p>
<p>Steal percentage is a good indicator of who is going to be successful. Some players go for steals too much though.</p>
<p><em>Sports internet</em></p>
<p>A <a href="https://today.sportsinternet.co/">weekday newsletter</a> with top stories in sports. It&rsquo;s delightful to read. Feels so honest, and simple. Cool project.</p>
<p><em>Bill James</em></p>
<p>This <a href="http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2004/11/abstracts_from_19.php">abstracts of baseball abstracts</a> is fun to read. So many tidbits about how to think a bit differently.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>be specific - why not separate fielding from throwing when looking at errors?</li>
<li>looking at player performance, access team age - be specific, a player is 29.8 years old, not just 29</li>
<li>runs scored and prevented is a valid test that correlates with winning</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s good to be an outsider, there is a different perspective than an insider</li>
<li>context is really important, park effects is bigger influence than you think</li>
<li>whenever you talk yourself into needing a player, you pay too much</li>
<li>things that can&rsquo;t be measured easily are still incredibly important</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to read more of these summaries of the abstracts.</p>
<p>Also, found <a href="https://www.billjamesonline.com/two_unrelated_essays/">his post from 2017 really interesting</a> - multiple things can be true. Controversial subject, but a lot of objectivity and common sense.</p>
<p><em>Quote that sums it up</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We’re overlooking the root of the problem. The root of the problem is enforced patriotism.   Forcing people to go through patriotic gestures has always been a poor idea.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Metaphor that made sense</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bill James asks if you can tell the height of a tree by standing beside it and looking up. &ldquo;No, of course not; it&rsquo;s too big.&rdquo; He says you must stand back and look at the tree from a distance to get an idea how tall it is.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating">Creating</h2>
<ul>
<li>wrote article on Julius Peppers, <a href="https://fyi.dadgumboxscores.com/julius-frazier-peppers/">best defensive end in college basketball</a></li>
<li>fooled with football statistics some, charting games and success rate</li>
<li>interest in creating site that remixes classic games, yesterday&rsquo;s games today</li>
</ul>
<p>No real developments working with R this week, need to explore it more with data in future.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask why, and ask why again</li>
<li>If you want to someone to do something for you, use the word <em>because</em> or tell them why</li>
<li>Slow down, breathe</li>
<li>A proper distance is necessary for all relationships to work</li>
<li>Be objective</li>
</ul>
