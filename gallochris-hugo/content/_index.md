# Hi, I'm Chris.

And this is a place for me to stay curious.

I help teams build better software. I have experience in customer operations, support engineering, and product management. My focus is understanding what customers and teammates are trying to do, and helping them make progress. I work remotely from my home in Charlotte, North Carolina.
