# Hi, I'm Chris.

And this is [my little piece](/manifesto) of the world wide web. A place for me to stay curious.

I stay curious by playing with [data](https://fungo.hotdogsandeggs.com), writing to [think](https://blog.hotdogsandeggs.com), and reading to [learn](https://books.hotdogsandeggs.com).

My day job is helping teams build better software. I have experience in customer operations, support engineering, and product management. My focus is around understanding what customers are trying to do and _how_ to help them make progress.

I work remotely from my home in Charlotte, North Carolina and I spend my days building [{{< zipline "Zipline." >}}](https://www.retailzipline.com/) Our team makes it easier for retailers to communicate with each other.
