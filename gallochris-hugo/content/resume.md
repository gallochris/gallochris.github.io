> I hired Chris because he was already doing support for me at Draft for free and I hadn’t even asked him to :) He’s incredibly ambitious and helpful in every aspect of your business, way beyond typical support. He’ll run your business if you want him to. I promise you, customers will write in to you about how much they love Chris.

In addition to this personal site, I also love to try to make my own

on the web on my own. Here are a few static sites I've put together.

    men's basketball box score since 2003-2004.
