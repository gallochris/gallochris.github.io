What's up with hot dogs and eggs?
=======================================

* * * * *

Most people claim their own name as a domain (chrisgallo.com). But my
namesakes at Ernest and Julio Gallo Winery have commandeered domains
that include the word "gallo" in them.

So when I started this site in 2014, I was stumped on a domain name. And
then I heard my grandma talking about making hot dogs and eggs for me as
a kid. I kept saying it all day. Hot dogs and eggs. It made me smile :)

I bought the domain name and laughed. But it stuck. It's goofy and
different, just like me. A curious combination, hot dogs and eggs.

The name has come to mean much more to me. It's part of my philosophy. And it represents {{< yellow "what I believe."  >}}

The best answer is a **question**.

Listen to what people **do**, not just what they **say**.

**Less** is more.

**Simple** doesn't mean *easy*.

If it's not **useful or entertaining**, it's useless.
