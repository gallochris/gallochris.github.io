				<h1 id="02-a-non-zero-system">02: A Non-zero system</h1>
<p>Biggest learning this week was to develop a non-zero system. 1 &gt; 0. Remember that.</p>
<h2 id="consuming">Consuming</h2>
<p><em>Comment from reddit</em></p>
<p>This is maybe best <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/">reddit comment</a> I&rsquo;ve ever read. It comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ryans01">ryans01</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the 4 rules in my own words:</p>
<p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> be consistent, one is better than zero. Do at least something that can help you toward your goal or dream each day. Want to lose weight? Exercise. You don&rsquo;t have to run a marathon. Do a pushup. Take a walk.</p>
<p>Want to learn to program? Write a line of code. Build a silly website.</p>
<p>You now live in a non-zero system.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> become your own best friend. There are 3 of you - past you, present you, and future you. Ever decision you make should be to benefit your future self.</p>
<p>Life is a all about bets, your decisions are bets against your future self. Thank past you for helping future you, and you&rsquo;ll develop gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3</strong>: Forgive yourself. Self-pity accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re disappointed in yourself, you will be less productive. And that&rsquo;s bad for the non-zero system.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4</strong>: Exercise and books. When you exercise daily, you get smarter. It&rsquo;s more for your mind than for your body.</p>
<p>All-time quote about reading: <em>reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3.</em> It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><em>Superforecasting by Tetlock and Gardner</em></p>
<p>Rented the book from library, listened to a podcast about it, and <a href="http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2016/01/28/notes-on-superforecasting-the-art-and-science-of-prediction/">read these book notes</a>. It&rsquo;s a little dense, too many examples, but some big ideas that are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>triage: don&rsquo;t waste time trying to predict the unpredictable, focus on the right things</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s all about balance - overconfidence and underconfidence, perspectives, evidence</li>
<li>if facts change, you need to change</li>
<li>understand basic probability or odds</li>
</ul>
<p><code>60/40 is a 40% chance, 4 / 6+4=10, 25/1 is 3.85% chance, 1 / 25+1=26</code></p>
<p><em>Fermi-ize example: how many piano tuners are in Chicago?</em></p>
<p>Break it down into smaller questions, what must be true for me to answer this question?</p>
<ul>
<li>number of pianos in Chicago</li>
<li>how often are pianos tuned each year</li>
<li>how long does it take to tune a piano</li>
<li>how mamny hours a year the average piano tuner works</li>
</ul>
<p>Breaking down the question determines what is knowable and unknowable.</p>
<p><em>Charlie Munger</em></p>
<p>Still reading about Munger. I&rsquo;ve read lots of <a href="https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html">notes</a>, bits and pieces of this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151004200748/http://law.indiana.edu/instruction/profession/doc/16_1.pdf">misjudgement speech</a>, and some of <a href="https://25iq.com/2015/10/30/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-charlie-munger-distilled-to-less-than-500-words/">Tren Griffin&rsquo;s exhaustive list of posts</a>.</p>
<p>A few things I&rsquo;m chewing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid extreme ideologies, it gets you stuck on ideas</li>
<li>try to expose yourself to alternate viewpoints</li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re confident about something, you should be able to counter it or argue against it, if you can&rsquo;t - you don&rsquo;t fully understand what you&rsquo;re confident about</li>
<li>determination is important, keep it at it, take a break, but keep trying</li>
<li>rub your nose in your mistakes, own it</li>
<li>mistakes of omission happen, you never get over it, but you do less of it</li>
</ul>
<p>This <a href="https://25iq.com/quotations/charlie-munger/">list of quotes</a> is incredible.</p>
<p><em>Quote I&rsquo;m thinking about</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Practically everybody (1) overweighs the stuff that can be numbered, because it yields to the statistical techniques they’re taught in academia, and (2) doesn’t mix in the hard-to-measure stuff that may be more important. That is a mistake I’ve tried all my life to avoid, and I have no regrets for having done that. - Munger on statistics</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Metaphor that made sense</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I believe managing is like holding a dove in your hand. If you hold it too tightly you kill it, but if you hold it too loosely, you lose it. - Tommy Lasorda</li>
</ul>

<li>Need to keep going, try the sports course and make more graphs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s all about balance - moderation</li>
<li>Be a generalist.</li>
<li>Keep trying, keep trying, have some grit.</li>
<li>Try to do one-thing a day to help future you - exercise, read/learn, eat healthy.</li>
</ul>
