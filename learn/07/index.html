<h1 id="07-how-not-what">07: How not what</h1>

<p>Biggest takeaway this week was how &gt; what. In order to reshape your thinking habits, try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>be the best credit-giver</li>
<li>be the best mistake-admitter</li>
<li>be the best finder of mistakes in good-outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Thinking in Bets</em></p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions-ebook/dp/B074DG9LQF">Thinking in Bets</a> by Annie Duke and started to read this weekend.</p>

<p>Notes and excerpts:</p>

<p>Poker not chess. Life is more like poker, skill and luck. Chess is all skill.</p>

<p>Resulting - a good decision does not mean a good outcome and a bad decision does not mean bad a outcome. Run a red light and be fine. Go on green and get in accident.</p>

<p>Dr. Strangelove known for game theory. Game theory is making decision under conditions of uncertainty overtime.</p>

<p>The world doesn’t easily reveal the objective truth. Uncertainty can work a lot of mischief.</p>

<p>What makes a good decision is a good process, a process that accurately represents our <strong>current</strong> state of knowledge, which is always some variance of <em>I don’t know</em>.</p>

<p>More experience just means you can make a better guess.</p>

<p>We don’t perceive the world objectively, but our goal should be to <strong>try</strong>.</p>

<p>Get comfortable about not being sure and saying I don’t know.</p>

<p>A loss feels twice as bad as a win feels good.</p>

<p>All decisions are bets - buying a house, parenting, choose steak over chicken, going to the movies.</p>

<p>We can only make our best guess, given what we know and what we don’t know, at what the future will look like.</p>

<p>Instead of alternating our beliefs to fit new information, we do the opposite, altering our interpretation of that information to fit our beliefs.</p>

<p>Our preexisting beliefs influence the way we experience the world, and those beliefs are formed in not an orderly way, which means mischief is in our decision making.</p>

<p>The better you are with numbers, the better you are spinning those numbers to conform and support your beliefs.</p>

<p>We bet on our beliefs. We don’t vet those beliefs well before we form them. We stubbornly refuse to update our beliefs. And being smart doesn’t help, it makes it worse.</p>

<p>The more objective we are, the more accurate our beliefs become.</p>

<p>Almost nothing is black and white, 0 or 100, and that&rsquo;s pretty good philosophy for living.</p>

<p>We would be better served as communicators and decision-makers if we thought less about whether we are confident in our beliefs and more about <strong>how</strong> confident we are in those beliefs.</p>

<p>This way our expression of confidence would capture all the shades of grey in-between. It&rsquo;s a spectrum, 76% to 63% is much better than right or wrong.</p>

<p>Acknowledging uncertainty is the first step in measuring and narrowing it.</p>

<p>Any decision is a bet on what will likely create the most favorable future for us.</p>

<p>Sometimes things happen because of the other form of uncertainty - LUCK.</p>

<p>We can’t work backward from the quality of our outcome to determine the quality of our beliefs and decisions.</p>

<p>We always run into this problem: the way things turn out could be the result of our decisions, luck, or a combination of the two.</p>

<p><em>Quote: We must believe in luck, for how else can we explain the success of those we don’t like.</em></p>

<p>Golden rule of habit change - keep the old cue, deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine.</p>

<p>Keep the reward of feeling like we are doing well compared to our peers, but change the features by which we compare ourselves:</p>

<ul>
<li>be a better credit-giver than your peers</li>
<li>be more willing than others to admit mistakes</li>
<li>be more willing to explore reasons for an outcome with an open mind</li>
</ul>

<p>And even, and especially, if that might cast you in a bad light or shine a good light on someone else.</p>

<p>It’s easy to win a bet against someone that takes extreme positions.</p>

<p>Not all situations are appropriate for truth seeking, nor are all people interested in that pursuit.</p>

<p>Our decision making can improve if we find our people to join us in our truthseeking.</p>

<p>A focus on accuracy over confirmation, which includes rewarding truthseeking, objectivity, and open mindedness with the group.</p>

<p>Accountability, for which members have advance notice. Openness to a diversity of ideas.</p>

<p>Ask the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why might my belief not be true?</li>
<li>What other evidence might be out there bearing on my belief?</li>
<li>Are there similar areas I can look toward to gauge whether similar beliefs to mine are true?</li>
<li>What sources of information could I have missed or minimized on the way to reaching my belief?</li>
<li>What are the reasons someone else could have a different belief, what’s their support, and why might they be right instead of me?</li>
<li>What other perspectives are there as to why things turned out the way they did?</li>
</ul>

<p>A diverse group can help de-bias us.</p>

<p><em>Quotes I liked this week</em></p>

<ul>
<li>No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it has no bearing at all on <em>how</em> you live from now on.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating">Creating</h2>

<p>Not much this week. A lot more thought than doing, chewing on a blog post comparing situational stats and then a new writing project for sports ideas like:</p>

<ul>
<li>NFL ties - what happens after, impact on post-season, etc.</li>
<li>Do more women coach women collegiate sports, or still in minority?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li>Change your routine, keep the cue and reward the same</li>
<li>How, how, how</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t know it all, say I don&rsquo;t know and get used to that</li>
</ul>
