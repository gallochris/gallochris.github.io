				<h1 id="08-flexible-thinking">08: Flexible Thinking</h1>
<p>Biggest takeaway this week was try to be flexible in your thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li>be comfortable with uncertainty</li>
<li>be observant, pay attention to what people do not say</li>
<li>pay attention to actions, not just facts and numbers</li>
<li>get to the truth, don&rsquo;t always to try to organize it</li>
<li>unlearn things, ask why</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Thinking in Bets</em></p>
<p>Finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions-ebook/dp/B074DG9LQF">Thinking in Bets</a> by Annie Duke.</p>
<p>This book teaches us that life is poker not chess. We have to take satisfaction in assessing the probabilities of different outcomes given the decisions under consideration and in executing the bet we think is bet.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be an outcome junkie. You&rsquo;re going to lose a lot, and win a lot. You can always, however, try to make a good bet.</p>
<p>Learn how to navigate the uncertain future because you&rsquo;ll never be sure of the future. Try to calibrate your beliefs to a more accurate and objective representation of the world.</p>
<p>More notes:</p>
<p><strong>CUDOS</strong>: principles for a good trust group</p>
<p><strong>Communism</strong>: be a data sharer, more data you share leads to better assessment</p>
<ul>
<li>rashomon effect: two accounts of same event, but versions are dramatically different because they&rsquo;re informed by different facts and perspectives</li>
<li>you can&rsquo;t assume your version of the story is accurate or complete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Universalism</strong>: don&rsquo;t shoot the message, imagine if same info came from person you didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>Both of these are bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>negative opinion about person delivering message, we close our mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>positive opinion about person delivering message, we accept without vetting it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>listen to the other side to look for things you agree with, when we do this, we learn things we otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have learned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the only way to gain knowledge and approach truth is by examining every variety of opinion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disinterestedness</strong>: telling someone how a story ends encourages them to be resulters</p>
<ul>
<li>we don&rsquo;t process information independent of the way we wish the world to be</li>
<li>outcome blindness enforced disinterestedness</li>
<li>if the group is blind to the outcome, it produces higher fidelity evaluation of decision quality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organized skepticism</strong>: discussion among the group to encourage engagement and dissent</p>
<ul>
<li>lean over backwards to figure out where we could be wrong</li>
<li>skepticism is about asking why things might not be true rather than why they are true</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to communicate with group</strong></p>
<p><strong>Express uncertainty</strong>: listen for things you agree with, state those and be specific, follow with <em>and</em> instead of <em>but</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>and</em> is an offer to contribute</li>
<li><em>but</em> is a denial and repudiation of what came before</li>
<li>try using <em>yes and</em></li>
<li>ask do you want to let it all out or are you thinking about what to do next?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Focus on the future</strong>: we can identify the goals, our problem is the execution</p>
<ul>
<li>rehashing our past can create defensiveness</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s hard to be defensive about something that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet</li>
<li>have you thought about how you would get rid of all this drama in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: child with bad test scores - it must be hard to have a teacher like that, do you think there is anything you can do to improve your grade in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Consequences take awhile to show</strong>: what does the intern possibly know? It could take years for that intern to become a successful competitor before that mistake becomes obvious</p>
<ul>
<li>improving decision quality is about increasing our chances of good outcomes, not guaranteeing them</li>
<li>when we make in-the-moment decisions, and don&rsquo;t ponder our past or future, we are more likely to be irrational and impulsive</li>
<li>thinking about the future is remembering the future</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Temporal discounting</strong> - favor our present self at the expense of our future self</p>
<p><strong>Move regret in front of our decisions</strong>: have a loss agreement, regret decision of losing lots of chips before you bought more</p>
<ul>
<li>imagine how future-you is likely to feel about the decision or imagine how you feel today if past-you made the decision</li>
<li>how would you feel if you made the decision 10 minutes ago? 10 months ago? 10 years ago?</li>
</ul>
<p>This does two things:</p>
<p>1 - influences us to make a better decision
2 - helps us treat ourselves more compassionately</p>
<ul>
<li>we aren&rsquo;t that good at taking this kind of perspective, accessing the past and the future to get a better view of how any given moment might fit into the scope of time</li>
<li>happiness is not best measured by looking at the ticker, zooming in and magnifying moment-by-moment or day-by-day movements</li>
<li>the way field outcomes is path dependent</li>
<li>it doesn&rsquo;t so much matter where we end up as <em>how</em> we got there</li>
<li>our feelings are not a reaction to the average of how things are going</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is tilt?</strong>: if you blow some recent event out of proportion and react in a drastic way, you&rsquo;re on tilt</p>
<ul>
<li>blowing out of proportion a momentary event because of an in-the-moment emotional reaction</li>
<li>long view thinking is more rational thinking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ulysses contract</strong>: past-us preventing present-us from doing something stupid</p>
<p>Examples: take a ride share when going to a bar, automatic allocation into retirement fund</p>
<ul>
<li>wrong is a conclusion, not a rationale</li>
<li>if we&rsquo;re going to be self-critical, the focus should be on the lesson and how to calibrate future decisions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of scouting the future</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1st: scenario planning reminds us that the future is inherently uncertain, more realistic</li>
<li>2nd: we are better prepared for how we are going to respond to different outcomes that might result from our initial decision, anticipate positive or negative developments instead of being reactive</li>
<li>3rd: being able to respond to the changing future is a good thing, being surprised by the changing future is not</li>
<li>4th: less likely to fall for hindsight or resulting bias</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected value</strong>: probability gets you to prioritize</p>
<p>Example when applying for Grants:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100,000 grant has 25% chance of winning (expected value is $100k * .25 = $25,000)</li>
<li>$200,000 grant has 10% chance of winning (expected value is $20,000)</li>
<li>$50,000 grant has 70% chance of winning (expected value is $35,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that the $50,000 grant is more valuable than the $100,000 and $200,000 grants.</p>
<p><strong>Backcasting</strong>: when we forecast the future, the present and the immediate future look large, anything beyond that loses focus</p>
<ul>
<li>prospective hindsight, imagining that an event has already occurred, increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Premortem</strong>: imagine a negative outcome</p>
<ul>
<li>backcasting is cheerleader, premortem is the heckler in the audience</li>
<li>incorporating negative visualization makes us more likely to achieve our goals</li>
<li>more likely to execute goals if we think about negative futures</li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it helps us anticipate potential obstacles and improve our likelihood of succeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Tree metaphor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the trunk of the tree is the past</li>
<li>branches are potential futures</li>
<li>when a potential future doesn&rsquo;t happen, don&rsquo;t chop it down (give the chainsaw a rest)</li>
<li>when you look into the past and only see what happened, it seems inevitable</li>
</ul>
<p>Hindsight bias is the enemy of probabilistic thinking.</p>
<p><em>Tao Jones of Averages</em></p>
<p>After searching Charlie Munger quotes, came across <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Jones-Averages-Whole-Brained-Investing-ebook/dp/B00FKZN4W6">this book by Bennett Goodspeed</a> and got it via Kindle. Read it in one day, it was that good.</p>
<p>Book teaches you about whole-brain investing, the differences between your left and right brain. Left brain is analytical and right brain is more gut instinct. More highlights via <a href="https://readwise.io/bookreview/289591">ReadWise</a>.</p>
<p>Anecdotes or excerpts:</p>
<p><strong>How we often think</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we try to understand running water by catching it in a bucket</li>
<li>remember to look for soft data, just because it&rsquo;s not easily measured doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not important</li>
<li>predictions are often wrong because what is <em>not</em> taken into account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Taoism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taoism is all about how opposites are interconnected</li>
<li>yin and yang, long and short, life and death are fused into one, as each depends on its counterpart for full completion</li>
<li>when opposites supplement each other, everything is harmonious</li>
<li>opposites get their meaning from each other and find their completion only through each other</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wisdom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>attain knowledge by adding things, attain wisdom by removing things</li>
<li><strong>analexia</strong>: if something can&rsquo;t be measured or analyzed, it&rsquo;s not real</li>
<li>one has to return to childlike ways by unlearning the rules of man and society, and thus be free to allow the unconscious mind to work effectively</li>
<li><strong>Wu Wei</strong> means rolling with the punches, swimming with the current, and winning by attraction and attitude rather than by deed and compulsion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to govern or manage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in government, one should &ldquo;govern a large country as you would cook a small fish; lightly</li>
<li>the more laws are enacted and taxes assessed, the greater the number of law-breakers and tax evaders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Left Brain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>controls the right side of the body, is analytically oriented</li>
<li>it reasons logically and sequentially and is responsible for our speech</li>
<li>adept at math, accounting, languages, science, and writing</li>
<li>like a computer, it is programmable and is nurtured by our highly analytic educational process</li>
<li>the properties of the left brain are not unique; man has developed computers that can duplicate those functions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right Brain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>controls the movements of the left side of the body, is unique</li>
<li>operates nonsequentially, is intuitive, artistic, has feelings</li>
<li>gestalt-oriented (sees the forest and not just the trees)</li>
<li>controls our visual perceptions</li>
<li>since it&rsquo;s nonverbal, it communicates to us through dreams and &ldquo;gut reactions&rdquo;</li>
<li>provides and stores all of our nonverbal experience; a vast amount of input, certainly much more than we can verbally retrieve from our left brain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qualitative info</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>though we are told not to compare apples and oranges, we continually do so by translating them into numbers</li>
<li>in the process, we tend to lose track of their intangible properties such as taste, nutrition, and aesthetics</li>
<li>we continue to honor yang values by demanding credentials of anyone who asks us to look at what is new, rather than looking at the evidence itself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bad Education System</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>educational system emphasizes being &ldquo;right&rdquo; at the expense of being open</li>
<li>this teaches our youth to be still, to look to authority, and to construct certainties</li>
<li>it ingrains self-limiting behavior and promotes competition for the highest grades</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to improve education system</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>teaching should not be done by describing and pointing out differences, but by example</li>
<li>what students need to learn is freedom, high expectations, awareness, patterns, connections, and creativity</li>
<li>&ldquo;Whereas the young need some sort of initiation into an uncertain world, we give them bones from the culture&rsquo;s graveyards. Where they want the real thing, we give them abstract busy work, where they need to find meaning, the schools ask memorization, and discipline becomes divorced from intuition, patterns from parts.&rdquo;</li>
<li>we should teach creativity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Model of creativity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification</li>
<li>preparation: do your homework, research it (left brain)</li>
<li>incubation: sleep on it, take a walk, reflect (right brain)</li>
<li>illumination: eureka moment (left and right brain come together)</li>
<li>verification: confirm your discovery (left brain)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>just before a trend changes, there will be maximum agreement by experts and others that the trend will not end</li>
<li>to deal with discomfort of uncertainty, man tends to create a false sense of security by substituting certainty for uncertainty</li>
<li>irony is that the greater the uncertainty, the greater the similarity of predictions, as the experts &ldquo;shout&rdquo; together in the dark</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comedy and Tragedy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a comedy is when the characters discover reality in time to do something about it; a tragedy is when the characters do not</li>
<li>stupidity well packaged can sound like wisdom</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thinking and dealing with uncertainty</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>since vision is the most information rich of all senses, visual thinking is extremely important and powerful</li>
<li>in order to extrapolate what is missing, you need to use the right hemisphere, as it is by far the one best suited to deal with incomplete information</li>
<li>watch out for the man whose stomach doesn&rsquo;t move when he laughs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inference</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to infer is to arrive at a decision or opinion by reasoning from known facts or evidence (e.g., from your smile, I infer that you&rsquo;re pleased)</li>
<li>an inference can also be a matter of making connections between events that are not obviously related</li>
<li>General Patton observed the anomaly of cart tracks and made the connection that the Germans were low on gas; a rather creative and important leap</li>
<li>inferential thinking, however, is very much whole brained; the left brain stores up the knowledge acquired during the reading so as to provide a background against which the right brain can spot anomalies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>crisis equals danger and opportunity</li>
<li>As crisis is comprised of danger and opportunity, those who sense change in the early stages will tend to have the most bountiful harvest</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading is important for inference</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reading serves as a &ldquo;radar screen&rdquo; on which the anomalies, or clues of change, first appear</li>
<li>provides a feeling for what is normal, as one needs to know normality in order to recognize an anomaly</li>
<li>broad-based readings allow one to spot a change in one field that will impact another</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Quotes I liked this week</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It takes a long time to grow young.</li>
